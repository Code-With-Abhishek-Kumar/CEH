# CIA Triad

- The CIA Triad is a fundamental concept in information security that stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It serves as a framework for evaluating and implementing security measures to protect sensitive information and ensure the proper functioning of IT systems. Here's a detailed explanation of each component:

1. `Confidentiality (Gopniyata):`

-  This means keeping information private and only accessible to those who are authorized to access it. Think of it like keeping a secret; you only share certain information with people who need to know.

- Ye matlab hai ki jaankari ko niji rakhna aur sirf un logon tak hi pahunchana jo us tak pahunchane ke liye authorized hain. Isko ek raaz rakhne ki tarah sochiye; aap sirf woh jaankari share karte hain jo zarooratmand logon ko pata honi chahiye.



2. `Integrity (Akriti):`

- Integrity ensures that information is accurate and trustworthy. It means that data hasn't been altered or tampered with in any unauthorized way. Imagine if someone changed the numbers in a report; integrity ensures that doesn't happen without permission.

- Akriti yeh ensure karta hai ki jaankari sahi aur vishwasniya ho. Iska matlab hai ki data mein kisi prakar ka badlav ya parivartan na kiya gaya ho bina kisi anumati ke. Sochiye agar koi report mein numbers ko badal deta; akriti yeh ensure karta hai ki yeh anumati ke bina nahi hota.

3.` Availability (Upalabdhata):`

- Availability ensures that information is accessible to authorized users when they need it. It's like making sure a website is up and running when people want to visit it. If information isn't available when it's needed, it's not very useful.

- Upalabdhta yeh ensure karta hai ki jaankari ko un authorized users ke liye uplabdh kiya jaye jab unhein zaroorat hoti hai. Yeh waise hi hai jaise ek website up aur chal rahi ho jab log usse visit karna chahte hain. Agar jaankari jab zaroori hai tab uplabdh nahi hai, toh woh bahut upyogi nahi hai.

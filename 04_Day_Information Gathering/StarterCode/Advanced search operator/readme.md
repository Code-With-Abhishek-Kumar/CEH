# Advanced search operator


## Inurl


The inurl: operator restricts search results to pages where the specified term appears in the URL.

`For example,`

- if you search for inurl:healthy eating, Google will return pages with “healthy” and “eating” in their URLs.

- You can also use multiple terms with inurl: to find pages where all those terms appear in the URL.


`Google.com:`

- Google.com is the primary domain for Google’s search engine.
When you search for something on Google, you’re essentially querying the vast index of web pages that Google has crawled and indexed.


- So, when you search for “inurl: google.com,” you’re asking Google to find pages where the term “google.com” appears in the URL. This could include various subdomains or specific pages hosted on Google’s domain1.




## intitle


- The intitle: search operator is a powerful tool for refining your web searches. When you use intitle: followed by a specific word or phrase, it instructs the search engine to return results where that word or phrase appears in the title of web pages. Let me break it down for you:

- intitle:term: This query restricts results to documents containing the specified term in their titles. 


`For example:`

- If you search for intitle:recipe chocolate cake, the search engine will return pages with “chocolate cake” in their titles.

- Similarly, intitle:best museums Sydney will find pages where the words “best,” “museums,” and “Sydney” appear in the titles1.


##  allintext

- The allintext: search operator is a powerful tool for refining your web searches. 

- When you use allintext: followed by specific words or phrases, it instructs the search engine to return results where all of those words or phrases appear in the body text of web pages. 

- allintext:term1 term2 ...: This query restricts results to documents containing all the specified terms in their body text. For example:

- If you search for allintext:travel packing list, the search engine will return pages where the words “travel,” 
“packing,” and “list” all appear in the text of the page.
Essentially, it functions as if you used double quotes (" ") around individual words, ensuring they all appear together in the content12.

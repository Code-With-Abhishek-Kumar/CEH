# Passive Reconnaissance


 - Passive reconnaissance, also known as passive information gathering or passive footprinting, refers to the process of collecting information about a target or network without directly interacting with it. This approach aims to gather intelligence using publicly available sources and techniques that do not involve sending requests or probes that could alert the target to the reconnaissance activities.


 - Passive reconnaissance ko hum 'nishechit jaankari ikattha karna' bhi kehte hain. Iska matlab hai ki hum kisi lakshya ya network ke baare mein jaankari ikattha karte hain bina seedhe usse interact kiye. Is prakriya mein hum aam taur par janta se uplabdh srot (jaise websites, social media, samachar, sarkari dastavejon, etc.) ka istemal karte hain aur aise techniques ka prayog karte hain jo lakshya ko anumaan nahi dilaate hain ki hum unki jaanch kaaryavaahi kar rahe hain.




 ## Here are some common methods used in passive reconnaissance


 1. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT):

 - Gathering information from publicly available sources such as websites, social media, news articles, public records, and government documents.


 2. WHOIS Lookup: 


 - Finding information about domain registrations, including domain owner details, contact information, and registration dates.


 3. Network Enumeration:

 - Identifying network blocks, IP ranges, and possible network infrastructure details using tools like ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) or RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens).


 4. Google Dorking:


 - Using advanced search techniques in search engines like Google to find information not easily accessible through conventional browsing.



5. Social Engineering: 


- Gathering information through interactions with people associated with the target organization, such as employees or customers.

6. Dumpster Diving: 

- Searching through physical or digital trash (like discarded documents or improperly secured digital files) for sensitive information.


7. Passive DNS (Domain Name System) Analysis:


- Collecting DNS records and observing changes and trends over time to understand network topology and infrastructure.



8. Passive Traffic Analysis: 


-  Monitoring network traffic passively to gather information about network hosts, communication patterns, and potentially sensitive data being transmitted.



- Passive reconnaissance aam taur par penetration testing ya security assessment prakriya ka pehla kadam hota hai. Isse humare attackers ya security professionals lakshya ke baare mein mahatvapurn jaankari ikattha kar sakte hain, jo baad mein hamla ya suraksha niti ke aage ke kadam rakhne mein upayogi hoti hai. 

- Yah dhyaan mein rakhna jaroori hai ki jabki passive reconnaissance seedha pravesh nahi hai, waise prapt jaankari aage ke active reconnaissance ya exploit prayason ke liye mahatvapurn ho sakti hai.



## We will learn three command-line tools:

1. `whois` to query WHOIS servers

2. `nslookup` to query DNS servers

3. `dig` to query DNS servers

# What is Hacking ? üòÅ


- Hacking cyber security mein hota hai jab devices jaise computers, smartphones, tablets, aur networks ko galat istemal kiya jata hai taaki systems ko nuksan pahuchaya ja sake, users ke baare mein jaankari collect kiya ja sake, data aur documents churaya ja sake, ya fir data se judi gatividhiyon mein rukavat paida kiya ja sake.


- Hacking refers to the unauthorized or unauthorized access, modification, or manipulation of computer systems, networks, or data. It's essentially the act of exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems to achieve a goal, whether that goal is exploration, learning, security testing, or malicious intent.

## 1. White Hat Hackers:

- White Hat Hackers, also known as ethical hackers, are individuals who use their technical skills to help improve organizations' cybersecurity. Their goal is to keep the systems and networks of organizations secure and to prevent threats.


- White Hat Hackers, jo ki "ethical hackers" ke roop mein bhi jaane jaate hain, ve hain jo apne technical skills ka istemal karke organizations ki cybersecurity mein sudhaar karne mein madad karte hain. Unka uddeshya hota hai sangathanon ke systems aur networks ko surakshit rakhna aur khatron se bachav karna.

- Inhe anumati di jaati hai systems aur networks ko parikshan karne ke liye taaki ve vulnerabilities aur weaknesses ko pehchaan sakein aur unhe sudhaar sakein. White Hat Hackers legal taur par kaam karte hain aur unka uddeshya sirf suraksha ko behtar banane mein madad karna hota hai, kisi bhi apradhik gatividhi ke liye nahi.

## 2. Black hat hackers


- Black Hat Hackers are the bad guys of the hacking world. They use their computer skills to do harmful things, like stealing personal information, messing up computer systems, and causing trouble for people and companies. 

- Unlike White Hat Hackers, who use their skills to help make things safer, Black Hat Hackers break the rules and do illegal stuff. They might hack into computer systems to make money or to cause problems just for fun. Their actions can cause a lot of damage and get them into big trouble with the law.


- Black Hat Hackers woh hote hain jo hacking ke duniya ke bure log hote hain. Unka istemal karte hue ve apne computer ke hunar ka galat istemal karte hain, jaise ki personal jaankari chura lena, computer systems ko kharab karna, aur logon aur companies ko pareshani mein daalna. 

- White Hat Hackers ke vipreet, jo apne hunar ka istemal karke cheezon ko surakshit banane mein madad karte hain, Black Hat Hackers niyamon ka ulangan karte hain aur kanoon ke viruddh kaam karte hain. Ve computer systems mein hack kar sakte hain paise kamane ke liye ya fir sirf mazaak ke liye pareshani paida karne ke liye. Unka kaam bahut nuksaan pahuncha sakta hai aur unhe badi musibaton mein daal sakta hai kanoon ke saath.


## 3. Grey Hat Hackers:


- Grey Hat Hackers are like the middle ground between good and bad hackers. They might sometimes do things that are against the rules, like accessing computer systems without permission, but they're not always trying to cause harm. Sometimes, they discover problems in computer systems and networks, but instead of using them for their benefit, they tell the owners about the issues and offer to help fix them. So, they're not completely good or bad, they're somewhere in between.

- Grey Hat Hackers hote hain jo acche aur bure hackers ke beech ka madhya marg hote hain. Kabhi-kabhi ve niyamon ka ulangan karte hain, lekin ve hamesha nuksan pahunchane ki koshish nahi karte. Ve kabhi-kabhi samasyaon ko khote hain, lekin unka istemal apne fayde ke liye nahi karte. Ve samasyaon ke malik ko batakar madad karne ki peshkash karte hain.





## 4. Script Kiddies:

- Script Kiddies are individuals who lack advanced technical skills but still attempt to hack into computer systems or networks by using pre-made hacking tools and scripts developed by others. 

- They typically rely on ready-made software rather than creating their own exploits. Script Kiddies often engage in hacking activities for attention, excitement, or to prove their abilities without fully understanding the technical aspects of hacking. They are generally considered less skilled and sophisticated compared to other types of hackers.


- Script Kiddies woh hote hain jo hacking mein naye hote hain aur doosron dwaara banaye gaye tools aur programs ka istemal karte hain computer systems mein pravesh karne ke liye. Unke paas advanced skills nahi hote lekin ve tayyar software par nirbhar karte hain. Ve yeh mazaak ya dikhawa karne ke liye karte hain, bina yeh samajhne ki puri tarah se kaise kaam karta hai. Ve doosre hackers ke mukable mein itne mahir aur samajhdar nahi hote hain.




## 5. State-sponsored hackers:


- State-sponsored hackers are hackers who work for a government or government agency. They are hired to do cyber activities like stealing secrets, disrupting systems, or attacking other countries. They are usually very skilled and have a lot of resources. They use advanced techniques to hide their identity and may target different sectors like government agencies, military, or businesses. Their actions can cause big problems between countries.


- State-sponsored hackers woh hackers hote hain jo kisi sarkar ya sarkari agency ke liye kaam karte hain. Unhein cyber activities jaise ki rahasya chori karna, systems mein badhaav laana, ya doosre deshon ko hamla karna ke liye hire kiya jaata hai. Usually, inki bahut achhi skills hoti hain aur unke paas bahut saara resources hota hai. Ve apni pehchan chhupane ke liye advanced techniques ka istemal karte hain aur vibhinn sectors jaise sarkari agency, sena, ya vyapar ko target kar sakte hain. Unka kary deshon ke beech bade problem paida kar sakta hai.
